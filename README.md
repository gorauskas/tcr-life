# tcr-life

This was a simple exercise in using an agile development workflow technique: [TCR](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864) or `test && (commit || revert)`

The goal was to create a minimum Game Of Life using only a HashSet to represent the world and a Tuple of int to int to represent the cells. Written using C# in .NET Core 3.1 by creating the tests first and then code something small to allow the tests to pass or fail. 

Redo the above until happy with the result. 

All tests are passing, but my C# is rusty...
